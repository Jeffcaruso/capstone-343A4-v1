# Capstone Prototype of CSS 343 - A4 - Movie

## Jeffrey Caruso Fall 2023 - Winter 2024

### Info
- This Repo is autograder for 343 A4 Movie, as a component in my Capstone project.

## Tips for students
### General Tips
 - Look for TODO (Student)
 - Remember to consult previous assignments for an implemented example of gTest for these projects
 - [gTest Docs](https://google.github.io/googletest/)

### applib related tips
 - Build file should be ok (no need for student to edit)
 - Put all your classes (code files) in app lib folder
 - use ".h", ".cpp" for your code files

### data related tips
 - To add another data file, add the data.txt to the data folder
 - Then, add its name to export files in build file like all the other text files

### tests related tips
 - Tests build file should be ok (no need for student to edit)
 - the "TODO (Student)"s in the Test starter files provided explain the necessary hints

### building.cpp related tips
 - The goal here is to make objects of student classes, and call at least some of their methods this will make finding build errors easier (and make it so the build step fails and doesn't bother running the tests which would also fail, saving compute) 
 - the "TODO (Student)"s explain what to do
